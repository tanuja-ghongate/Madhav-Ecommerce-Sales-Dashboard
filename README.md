 📊  Project Description
From Data to Decision: Ecommerce Analytics Dashboard is a comprehensive Power BI project built to analyze and visualize ecommerce sales data. The dashboard transforms raw transactional data into meaningful insights, helping businesses understand performance across multiple dimensions.
